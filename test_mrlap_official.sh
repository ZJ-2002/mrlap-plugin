# WO-R-02 parity gate: replay the three seed1 canonical edges (XM, XY, MY)
# through scripts/mrlap.sh and compare every 17-field summary value against
# the frozen WOE4_mrlap_summary_seed1.tsv.
#
#   default          host R mode: uses the canonical host library
#                    (MRlap 0.0.3.3 / GenomicSEM 0.0.5 / TwoSampleMR 0.7.11
#                    exactly as the seed1 acceptance environment)
#   MRLAP_CONTAINER=1  container mode: runs inside MRLAP_IMAGE with the
#                    LD assets bind-mounted at /panels/ldsc_assets
#                    (tolerance stays at 1e-12; container BLAS may move
#                    the last bits — a failure there is information, not
#                    a reason to loosen the gate silently)
